# SASS/SCSS Mixins

This is my collection of SASS/SCSS mixins. I include this this file as a starting point for most of my prototyping projects.

## How to use

Add the file _mixins.scss to your project’s stylesheets folder.

```scss
@import 'path/to/_mixins.scss'
```

Make sure that you include this file before any other .scss files that will reference the mixins.

I’ve built this repository as a [Middleman app](http://middlemanapp.com) so you can test the mixins independently of your own projects. After you clone the repository, at the command line run:

    $ middleman server

Then open http://localhost:4567 in your browser.
